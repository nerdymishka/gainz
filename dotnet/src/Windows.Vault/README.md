# üîê  NerdyMishka.Windows.Vault üîê

Windows Credential Store access done right.

## Overview

This library can access the Windows Credential Store and will keep passwords or certificates
safe in memory until the data is decrypted.

By default the password, certficate, or other key data types are stored encrypted in memory with
Salsa20. A consumer of this library can then call `GetBlobAsSecureString`, `GetBlobAsBytes`,
`GetBlobAsChars` or `GetBlobAsString`. Its recommended to avoid calling `GetBlobAsString` unless
absolutely necessary.

next.SetBlob("my-great-and-terrible-password");
VaultManager.Write(next);

// find an entry.
var findOne = VaultManager.Read("gainz/test");
if(findOne == null)
    throw new System.Exception("entry for 'gainz/test' could not be found.");
