# Chocolatey Packages

## Kweh

Kweh.Extension is a chocolatey extension that targets the installation
of usb/portable projects.

It clones/modifies some of the functionality in chocolatey to provide
standardization for usb packages. It also allows extraction from
MSI files using the `/a` command rather performs an install to allow
portable installs that don't require registery interactions.
